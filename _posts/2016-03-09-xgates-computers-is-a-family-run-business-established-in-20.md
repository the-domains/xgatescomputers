Xgates Computers is a family run business, established in 2004 by Nigel Hempsall, we carry out repairs and sales to both Notebooks and desktop computers, including building custom machines to your needs.  Originally all work was undertaken solely by Nigel, but as his reputation for quality workmanship, excellent customer care and fair pricing grew, so did the business. By 2009 Xgates Computers needed to expand into much larger premises, with a custom built Service Area and Store Front.

Nigel sadly passed away in 2009 not long after Xgates Computers expanded but it is now run and owned by Nigel's son Leigh and we have a fantastic team of highly skilled and experienced Technicians who all work to the same high standards set by Nigel.

Our large Customer Base, which ranges from PC Novices to Small Businesses, has been built on the same honest, hardworking principles which Xgates Computers was started with 10 years ago.  Customer Care is our main priority and we believe in providing all our Customers with the same high level of Customer Care and Service we would expect ourselves and we are always looking to improve. 

There are no Sales People here at Xgates Computers only Technicians, who will listen to you, assess your needs and requirements based on YOU and offer you a solution that best suits YOU, there is no Hard sell only good, friendly advice. We speak English, not Tech Speak, and endeavour to do so with a friendly, honest and open attitude.

With Technology constantly moving forwards, so is Xgates Computers. As such with the recent increase in Smart Phones and Tablet PC's we have expanded our repairs to include Iphones and Ipads, also stocking a selection of accessories, which is proving to be a very integral part of our business.

With FREE parking right outside the shop access couldn't be any easier.

Pop in and see us today, even if just for a chat.
